# XGBoost & SHAP Model Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of Python scripts demonstrating the process of data preparation, model training, performance evaluation, and interpretability analysis using XGBoost and SHAP. These tools are particularly useful for those interested in applying advanced machine learning techniques to regression problems and seeking insights into model decisions through SHAP values.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Outlier detection and removal using z-scores.
- **Model Training**: XGBoost regression model training with detailed parameter tuning.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Extensive use of GridSearchCV to find optimal model settings.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculation of RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Interpretability**: Application of SHAP for explaining model predictions.
- **Visualizations**: Generate multiple types of plots including learning curves, SHAP feature importance, and dependence plots.

## ðŸ“Š Example Visualizations

Below are some of the visualizations that can be generated using the scripts in this repository:
